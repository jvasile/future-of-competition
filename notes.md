# Future Of Competition

Format options include 10-page policy paper, blog post, everything in
between.  1000 to 1500 words on up.

We need to balance the idealistic explanation of history and framing
with the practical reality of political limitations and current
structures.  Maybe those are two parts of the same doc, but they need
to be somewhat clearly separated.

# Potential Sections
## We're framing this wrong
 * Competition is about power of participants
 * when power hits coercive levels, we have problems
 * Coercion is a spectrum and some coercion might be ok
 * Omnipresence can create this coercion, not just monopoly
 * One antidote to this is options (or competition or agency)
 * Options != competition necessarily
 * Policy framed around monopoly isn't useful-- use can have coercion without monopoly, and the solutions aren't centered on competition.  We're also not worried about consumer pricing
 * Common carrier is another frame people reach for but there's no good reason for it here.
 * The availability of options is important even if you never take them (think forking open source code, or building new apps and services)
 * The traditional language, framing, and legal concepts around antitrust don't fit this. There are practical reasons to need to squeeze the internet circle into these squares to use existing law in litigation; but for new regulatory approaches, we can and should recognize the nature of this and approach it more effectively.
 * Maybe we can ask some EU folks for the framing over there so we can either take good ideas or cite them as more examples of poor framing
 * If competition is the wrong frame, maybe "Future Of Competition" is the wrong title
 * We need more work here to develop the *right* frame

## Stacks and edges
 * TCP/IP was the service until it became infra
 * Web was the service until it became infra
 * Maybe social isn't a service anymore, it's infra (and should be treated as such by law)
 * As things become infra, their coercive power naturally/inherently increases, which is why we need to start worrying about their openness (nobody cared that FB was ivy-only in 2003)
 * Options / agency come in at that point

## Politics
 * Do we think about this from an FTC or an FCC perspective?
 * Or do we need a new perspective entirely?
 * There's a mismatch between the political reality and the technical conversations
 * If we're saying monopoly is the wrong frame, we're kinda saying we don't care about FTC.  You can have your monopoly if I get my open access
 * At the same time, this is different from common carrier / historical communications paradigms where monopolies are inherently efficient and regulated


## What Should the Regulatory Approach Look Like?
 * The approach flows the framing we say is right in section 1
