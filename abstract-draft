Emerging amidst the global rise in antitrust investigations in the
internet sector, interoperability presents a different take on
promoting competition and openness than interventions which focus on
corporate restructuring and functional separations. Evaluated
alongside existing regulatory models, however, interoperability is
somewhat of an orthogonal proposal. This article evaluates the
distinct nature of interoperability as a remedy, suggesting that a
proper understanding of its objective and outcome is greater diversity
of user experience and an increase in user agency rather than direct
improvements in more traditional price or access metrics. Regulating
interoperability from that perspective will involve practical
challenges in balancing effectiveness with clarity of obligation. As a
result, new models of co-regulatory governance including extensive
engagement from all stakeholders should be explored.
