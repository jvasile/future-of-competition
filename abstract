As the world increasingly considers antitrust as a tool for governing
and shaping large internet companies, we ask whether traditional
antitrust analysis and remedies are well-suited to current regulatory
challenges.  We examine interoperability as a potential remedy,
suggesting that a proper understanding of its objective and outcome is
greater diversity of user experience and an increase in user agency
rather than direct improvements in more traditional price or access
metrics.  Regulating interoperability from that perspective will
involve practical challenges in balancing effectiveness with clarity
of obligation. As a result, new models of co-regulatory governance
including extensive engagement from all stakeholders should be
explored.
